Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: AI-generated list of potential business partnerships based on user data and market analysis.
* Milestone 2: Implementation of cross-promotional deals and packages with partner businesses.
7. Energy and Resource Optimization
Problem: Padel courts require intensive lighting and resource usage, increasing operational costs.
AI Solution: An intelligent system can manage energy consumption using sensors and algorithms to optimize lighting (e.g., LED systems) and irrigation systems for artificial grass, lowering operational costs.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Installation of energy and resource monitoring sensors on court facilities.
* Milestone 2: AI-controlled optimization of energy and resource consumption.
8. Health and Wellness Monitoring of Players
Problem: Lack of data on how padel impacts players’ health over time.
AI Solution: An AI system can collect health data via wearables and sports apps, evaluating how playing padel improves the physical condition of players, and offering personalized recommendations to avoid injuries and enhance overall well-being.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Integration with wearables and fitness apps for real-time health data collection.
* Milestone 2: AI-generated health insights and recommendations for individual players.
9. Automation of Reservation and Event Management
Problem: Manual handling of reservations and event organization can be inefficient and lead to double bookings or availability issues.
AI Solution: An AI assistant can automatically manage bookings, optimize court availability in real-time, and organize sports events based on demand and player availability.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Implementation of AI-assisted booking and event scheduling system.
* Milestone 2: Real-time optimization of court availability and event organization.
10. Optimized Court Design and Construction
Problem: The design and construction of courts do not always maximize durability or energy efficiency.
AI Solution: Using generative design algorithms, AI can optimize court designs, selecting more durable and sustainable materials, optimizing space, and reducing long-term construction and maintenance costs.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: AI-generated design models for court layout and material selection.
* Milestone 2: Construction and monitoring of first AI-optimized court
