Final project for the Building AI course.

## Summary

Padel Court Construction with AI Solutions. An IA solution kit to get better padel courts. 
This project aims to solve key issues related to padel court construction and management using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The solutions focus on improving user health, optimizing resources, and generating economic benefits.

## Background

1. Optimization of Court Location for New Builds
Problem: Choosing the best location for new padel courts to maximize usage and ROI.
AI Solution: AI can analyze geospatial, demographic, and user behavior data to identify areas with the highest potential demand.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Data collection and analysis from relevant geographic, demographic, and competitor databases.
* Milestone 2: AI system recommendation for the optimal location based on analysis.
2. Prediction of Seasonal Demand
Problem: Difficulty in predicting the fluctuating demand for courts throughout the year.
AI Solution: Predictive models using historical, weather, and local event data can forecast demand and adjust court availability, offers, or discounts accordingly.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Integration of historical usage, weather, and event data.
* Milestone 2: AI-generated forecast models that predict demand trends for the upcoming months.
3. Dynamic Pricing Management
Problem: Determining the optimal rental price for padel courts without losing users or revenue.
AI Solution: An AI-powered dynamic pricing system adjusts rental rates in real-time based on demand, time slots, competition, and user profile to optimize revenue.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Development of an AI model for dynamic pricing based on demand patterns.
* Milestone 2: Implementation and monitoring of pricing adjustments in real-time across multiple court locations.
4. Predictive Maintenance Optimization
Problem: Court and equipment deterioration can cause disruptions and expensive repairs.
AI Solution: AI can implement predictive maintenance using IoT sensors to collect data on usage and wear, anticipating the best time for repairs and minimizing unplanned damage.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Installation of IoT sensors on courts to monitor usage and wear.
* Milestone 2: AI-triggered maintenance schedules based on predictive analytics.
5. Personalization of Training Programs and Courses
Problem: Not all players have the same training needs, and course offerings may not align with real demand.
AI Solution: An AI system can recommend and personalize training programs based on each player's level, goals, and history, while adjusting the supply of courses based on local demand trends.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Development of a recommendation engine based on player profiles.
* Milestone 2: Rollout of personalized course offerings and training programs.
6. Partnerships with Complementary Businesses
Problem: Difficulty in identifying and establishing synergies with other businesses such as gyms, hotels, and sports shops.
AI Solution: AI can analyze consumer patterns and market trends to suggest strategic partnerships with local businesses that share potential customer bases, generating mutual benefits through cross-promotions and service packages.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: AI-generated list of potential business partnerships based on user data and market analysis.
* Milestone 2: Implementation of cross-promotional deals and packages with partner businesses.
7. Energy and Resource Optimization
Problem: Padel courts require intensive lighting and resource usage, increasing operational costs.
AI Solution: An intelligent system can manage energy consumption using sensors and algorithms to optimize lighting (e.g., LED systems) and irrigation systems for artificial grass, lowering operational costs.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Installation of energy and resource monitoring sensors on court facilities.
* Milestone 2: AI-controlled optimization of energy and resource consumption.
8. Health and Wellness Monitoring of Players
Problem: Lack of data on how padel impacts playersâ€™ health over time.
AI Solution: An AI system can collect health data via wearables and sports apps, evaluating how playing padel improves the physical condition of players, and offering personalized recommendations to avoid injuries and enhance overall well-being.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Integration with wearables and fitness apps for real-time health data collection.
* Milestone 2: AI-generated health insights and recommendations for individual players.
9. Automation of Reservation and Event Management
Problem: Manual handling of reservations and event organization can be inefficient and lead to double bookings or availability issues.
AI Solution: An AI assistant can automatically manage bookings, optimize court availability in real-time, and organize sports events based on demand and player availability.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: Implementation of AI-assisted booking and event scheduling system.
* Milestone 2: Real-time optimization of court availability and event organization.
10. Optimized Court Design and Construction
Problem: The design and construction of courts do not always maximize durability or energy efficiency.
AI Solution: Using generative design algorithms, AI can optimize court designs, selecting more durable and sustainable materials, optimizing space, and reducing long-term construction and maintenance costs.
Key Milestones:

* Milestone 1: AI-generated design models for court layout and material selection.
* Milestone 2: Construction and monitoring of first AI-optimized court
